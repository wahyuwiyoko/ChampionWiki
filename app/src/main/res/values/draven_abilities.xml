        <item>
            Draven gains his fans\' Adoration when he catches a Spinning Axe or kills a minion,
            monster, or tower. Killing enemy champions grants Draven bonus gold based on how much
            Adoration he has.

        <item>Spinning Axe</item>
        <item>
            Draven\'s next attack will deal bonus physical damage. This axe will ricochet off the
            target high up into the air. If Draven catches it, he automatically readies another
            Spinning Axe. Draven can have two Spinning Axes at once.

    <string-array name="draven_second_ability">
        <item>Blood Rush</item>
        <item>
            Draven gains increased Move Speed and Attack Speed. The Move Speed bonus decreases
            rapidly over its duration. Catching a Spinning Axe will refresh the cooldown of Blood
            Rush.

    <string-array name="draven_third_ability">
        <item>Stand Aside</item>
        <item>
            Draven throws his axes, dealing physical damage to targets hit and knocking them
            aside. Targets hit are slowed.

    <string-array name="draven_fourth_ability">
        <item>Whirling Death</item>
        <item>
            Draven hurls two massive axes to deal physical damage to each unit struck.
            Whirling Death slowly reverses direction and returns to Draven after striking an enemy
            champion. Draven may also activate this ability while the axes are in flight to cause
            it to return early. Deals less damage for each unit hit and resets when the axes reverse
            direction. Executes enemies who have less health than Draven\'s number of Adoration
            stacks.
