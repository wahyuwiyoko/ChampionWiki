            Yasuo\'s Critical Strike Chance is increased. Additionally, Yasuo builds toward a shield

            Thrusts forward, damaging all enemies in a line. On hit, grants a stack of Gathering
            Storm for a few seconds. At 2 stacks, Steel Tempest fires a whirlwind that knocks
            Airborne. Steel Tempest is treated as a basic attack and scales with all the same
