            Darius\' attacks and damaging abilities cause enemies to bleed for physical damage over
            5 seconds, stacking up to 5 times. Darius enrages and gains massive Attack Damage when
            his target reaches max stacks.

            Darius winds up and swings his axe in a wide circle. Enemies struck by the blade take
            more damage than those struck by the handle. Darius heals based on enemy champions and
            large monsters hit by the blade.

            Darius hones his axe, passively causing his physical damage to ignore a percentage of
            his target\'s Armor. When activated, Darius sweeps up his enemies with his axe\'s hook
            and pulls them to him.

        <item>
            Darius leaps to an enemy champion and strikes a lethal blow, dealing true damage.
            This damage is increased for each stack of Hemorrhage on the target. If Noxian
            Guillotine is a killing blow, its cooldown is refreshed for a brief duration.
